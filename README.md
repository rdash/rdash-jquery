## jQuery implementation of rdash

This dashboard front-end was created as I was lacking a simple responsive but slick looking dashboard for another project of mine.  Other available dashboards were bloated with external plugins and required a lot of hackery/work out of the box - plus the fact many were powered by jQuery. The design takes inspiration from other dashboards around, but the code to create the layout is my own.

### Usage

Simply clone, or download and unzip this repository and access the root via your browser. There is only one page on show (`index.html`), and the relevant sections have been commented.

If you want to use LESS, then cd into the root directory and

```
npm install

```

After that, run `gulp` in order to compile the LESS files into CSS.
